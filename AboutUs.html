            <h2>2021</h2>
            <p>
                In a time when high-performance PCs seemed out of reach for the average consumer, three friends came together with a shared vision: to make powerful, customizable computers accessible to everyone. Frustrated by the overpriced, proprietary, and unmodifiable systems dominating the market, they decided to take matters into their own hands. With no formal backing and limited resources, they set up a makeshift workshop in a cramped garage. Fueled by a mix of passion and determination, they spent countless late nights tinkering, experimenting, and learning.
    
                After months of hard work, they produced their first prototype — a compact and modular PC designed to be easily upgraded and tailored to individual needs. Though rough around the edges, this initial model was enough to ignite their dream of disrupting the industry. The prototype was far from perfect, but it represented the beginning of an exciting journey that would eventually lead them to revolutionize the world of personal computing.

                <h3>The Spark of an Idea</h3>
                <p>
                    It all began with an idea — a belief that high-quality PCs shouldn’t be limited to those with deep pockets. The team envisioned a future where technology was truly for everyone. Without access to fancy tools or funding, they relied on ingenuity, sketching their first concepts on napkins and scraps of paper. Every failure became a stepping stone to refining their vision.

                <h3>Prototype 1.0: A Humble Beginning</h3>
                <p>
                    The first prototype wasn’t just a computer; it was a statement of possibility. Built with off-the-shelf parts and a lot of creativity, it featured a sleek design and modular architecture that allowed for simple upgrades. While it wasn’t flawless, it proved that their concept was more than just a dream. It gave them the confidence to push forward.

            <p>
                Encouraged by the modest success of their prototype, the three friends doubled down on their efforts. With feedback from early testers, they refined their designs and improved the quality of their builds. Word of their project spread through tech forums, and soon, orders started rolling in. To keep up with demand, they expanded their operations beyond the garage, moving into a small but functional workshop.
    
                Recognizing the need for greater funding to scale their ambitions, they launched a crowdfunding campaign. The campaign resonated with a growing community of tech enthusiasts who shared their frustration with the PC market. Within weeks, they had exceeded their fundraising goal by a staggering 1,000%, raising enough to invest in advanced tools, hire additional team members, and build a proper production line. By the year’s end, they had sold their first batch of systems, establishing themselves as a promising new player in the industry.

                <p>
                    Transitioning from a small garage operation to a larger workshop wasn’t easy. There were logistical hurdles, production delays, and countless nights spent troubleshooting issues. However, with each obstacle came valuable lessons that shaped the team’s approach to design and manufacturing. This year also saw the addition of skilled engineers and designers who shared their vision, allowing the team to bring fresh ideas to the table.

                    The overwhelming support from their crowdfunding campaign validated their belief in the importance of community. Backers not only provided funding but also shared ideas and suggestions that helped shape the product’s next iteration. This collaborative relationship became a cornerstone of the brand, fostering a loyal customer base that championed their mission.
